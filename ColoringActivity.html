        <h1>Thorax: Chest Wall</h1>
        <h3>
            The chest wall contains the rib cage that gives
            attachment to muscles of the head and neck, the
            shoulder girdle, the back, the abdomen and the
            diaphragm. The cage is formed of the sternum
            anteriorly, the thoracic vertebrae posteriorly and
            twelve pairs of ribs between. The chest cavity houses
            and protects the heart, lungs and great vessels, and
            cage movement facilitates respiration. Figures 44a,
            99, 163 and 45a show the rib cage and its relationship
            to the bony pelvis.
